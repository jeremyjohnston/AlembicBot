Goal
---
The goal is to perform useful IR and IE task over the article data, to serve a query system whereby a user may find information on any infection disease or similar topic, and be presented with summary information and statistics on the media response.

The key queries focused on here will be infection diseases, and a measure of media response to that topic both over time, and across nations.

In this way, nations most affected physically, versus nations most reactive in the media to, the topic may be observed. See articles on physical disease vs. social disease.
